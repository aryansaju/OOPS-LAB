# 1. Basic Try-Except Block
try:
    a = 10
    b = 0
    c = a / b
    print("Answer of a/b:", c)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can't divide by zero.")

# 2. Handling Multiple Exceptions with a Single Except Clause
try:
    a = int(input("Enter value a: "))
    b = int(input("Enter value b: "))
    c = a / b
    print("The answer of a/b:", c)
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):
    print("Invalid input or division by zero.")

# 3. Try with Finally Block
try:
    a = int(input("Enter value a: "))
    b = int(input("Enter value b: "))
    c = a / b
    print("The answer of a/b:", c)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can't divide by zero.")
finally:
    print("Inside the finally block.")

# 4. Try with Else Block
try:
    a = int(input("Enter value of a: "))
    b = int(input("Enter value of b: "))
    c = a / b
    print("a/b = %d" % c)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can't divide by zero.")
else:
    print("We are in the Else block.")

# 5. Raising an Exception
def simple_interest(amount, year, rate):
    try:
        if rate > 100:
            raise ValueError("Interest rate out of range: %d" % rate)
        interest = (amount * year * rate) / 100
        print("The simple interest is", interest)
        return interest
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

# Example of calling the function
simple_interest(800, 6, 105)  # This will raise an exception because rate > 100
